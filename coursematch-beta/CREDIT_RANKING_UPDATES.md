# Course Match Tutorial - Credit & Ranking Updates

## ✅ New Guidance Added to Tutorial:

### 1. **Credit Increment Requirements** (NEW FAQ in Basics)
- **Must use 1.5 credit increments**
- Valid options: 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 6.0, 7.5, 9.0, 10.5, 12.0, 13.5, 15.0, 16.5, 18.0
- Explanation: CBS courses are typically 1.5 or 3.0 credits
- Full-time: 12-15 credits
- Part-time: 6-9 credits

### 2. **Avoid Over-Ranking** (Updated in "How many courses" FAQ)
- **Don't rank more than 25 courses**
- If taking 15 credits → Rank ~30 credits worth (not 120+!)
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Be strategic - rank courses you genuinely want

### 3. **Updated Common Mistakes**
Added two new mistakes:
- #3: Wrong credit increments (not using 1.5 increments)
- #4: Over-ranking courses (25+ courses for 15 credits)

### 4. **Chatbot Updates**
- 'credits' keyword → Explains 1.5 increment requirement
- 'increment' keyword → Details why 1.5 increments needed
- 'how many' → Updated to include "don't over-rank" advice

## Key Messages:

✅ **DO:**
- Use 1.5 credit increments (12.0, 13.5, 15.0, etc.)
- Rank 2x your target credits
- Focus on courses you genuinely want
- Be strategic and thoughtful

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use invalid increments (like 14.0 or 15.5)
- Rank 97 courses for a 15-credit schedule
- Add courses just to hit a number
- Create unnecessary overlap

## Rationale:
- Credit increments ensure valid schedule combinations
- Over-ranking creates confusion and overlap
- Quality rankings > Quantity rankings
- Students should be fair to themselves and the system
